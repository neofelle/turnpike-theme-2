A full-featured testimonials plugin that works right out of the box for beginners and offers advanced features for pros, all backed by strong support.

== Description ==

All the features you need to handle testimonials.

= Is this the right plugin for you? =

**[GO DEMO](http://demos.wpmission.com/strong-testimonials/)**

It's important to understand this plugin's intended use case: A small business with up to a few hundred testimonials, maybe organized into multiple categories, and displaying them a few different ways like a full page of testimonials and a slideshow widget, plus a form for accepting new testimonials.

If that describes your situation, this plugin will work for you right out of the box with just a few steps.

= Primary Features =

* No complicated shortcode "language"
* A front-end form with an easy-to-use editor
* Star ratings
* Categories
* Excerpts, both manual and automatic
* Featured Images (thumbnails)
* Pagination
* Slideshows with several navigation options
* Sort by oldest, newest, random, or menu order (drag-and-drop)
* Templates with several layout options including grids and Masonry
* Hooks, filters, and functions for deep customization
* Gravatar support
* Compatible with [WPML](https://wpml.org/), [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) and [WPGlobus](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpglobus/)
* A developer who's on your side :)

= The Form =

You can customize the form to your needs by adding or removing fields, or changing properties like the order, the text before or after, and the placeholder text.

The form also offers **anti-spam** options like honeypots and Captcha via these plugins: [Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/captcha/), [Really Simple Captcha](http://wordpress.org/plugins/really-simple-captcha/), and [Advanced noCaptcha reCaptcha](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-nocaptcha-recaptcha/).

**Notification emails** can be sent to multiple admins when testimonials are submitted. New testimonials can also be assigned to a specific category.

The form can be submitted via Ajax so it's compatible with popular plugins like [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/).

= Display =

Everything happens in a **view**. Instead of learning multiple shortcodes with dozens of options, a view contains all the options in a simple, intuitive editor that no other testimonial plugin has. Display the view using a single shortcode or the widget.

You can create unlimited views. For example, one view for the form, another view for a list, another for a slideshow, and so on.

Some of the options for displaying testimonials in a **list** or **slideshow**:

* which ones to show
* in what order
* which fields to include
* extras like pagination
* layout and style options

= Style =

Strong Testimonials offers a handful of templates to try in your theme. The default template is just generic enough to look good in most cases with maybe a few tweaks.

Need help matching your theme? Got some weird spacing or floating? I'm here to help.

For ultimate control and seamless integration, any template can be copied to your theme and customized (a tutorial and more templates coming soon). There is also a template function that can display any view.

= Try these plugins too =

* [tinyWYM Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinywym-editor/) to improve the WordPress Visual editor.
* [Simple Colorbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-colorbox/) to open thumbnails into full-size images. Nice!
* [Simple Custom CSS](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-custom-css/) for quick CSS tweaks.
* [Post State Tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-state-tags/) helps quickly differentiate Published / Pending / Draft and more.
* [Wider Admin Menu](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wider-admin-menu/) lets your admin menu b r e a t h e.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the shortcodes? =

[testimonial_view] - To display your testimonials as a list or a slideshow, or to display the form. There is no complicated shortcode "language" to learn. Instead, a **view** manages all the options with an easy-to-use (some call it fun!) editor for creating and configuring multiple views.

For example, after saving your first view (which, again, could be a list, a grid, a slideshow, or a form):

`[testimonial_view id=1]`

[testimonial_count] - To display the number of testimonials you have. For example:

`Read some of our [testimonial_count] testimonials!`

= Is it WPML compatible? =

Yes. Polylang too.

= Can I change the fields on the form? =

Yes. There is a custom fields editor where you can add or remove fields, change field details, and drag-and-drop to reorder them. That includes star ratings.

= Can I customize the form error message and the "Submit" button? =

Yes.

= Can I add Captcha to the form? =

Yes, the plugin integrates with three popular Captcha plugins.

= Can I add the form to a popup? =

Yes, with the excellent [Popup Maker](https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/) plugin.

= Can I receive a notification email when a new testimonial has been submitted? =

Yes, and you can send it multiple recipients.

= Can I edit the notification email? =

Yes. You can completely customize the email content and include any submitted information.

= After the form has been submitted, can I redirect them to another page or display a custom message? =

Yes and yes.

= Can I set the status of the newly submitted testimonial? =

Yes, either pending or published.

= Can I reorder my testimonials by drag and drop? =

Yes.

= I want to use categories. Can I add a category selector to the submission form? =

Yes. After setting up your categories, you can add a category dropdown or checklist to the form.

= Can I change which client fields appear below the testimonial? =

Yes. In views, these custom fields can be changed with a few clicks.

= My theme also includes testimonials. Will that be a problem? =

It depends. I have narrowed down the causes of many conflicts and addressed them in the plugin. If you encounter trouble, use the support form and we'll sort it out. If you want help disabling testimonials in your theme, even better. :)

= Can I import my existing testimonials? =

It depends. The plugin does not provide an import tool because every situation is different. With some technical skills, you may be able to successfully export your existing testimonials to a CSV file and import them into Strong Testimonials. Contact me if you want help with that. Otherwise, it may be simpler and easier to migrate them manually.

= I'm familiar with template files. Can I customize the template? =

Yes. With some HTML and CSS knowledge, you can copy any template to your theme and customize it as you see fit. You can also have multiple custom templates. Contact me for help.

= Can I display a large version of the featured image in a popup? =

Yes. This requires a lightbox so if your theme does not include one, you will need a plugin like [Simple Colorbox](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-colorbox/).

= Can I accept comments on my testimonials just like my blog posts? =

Yes.

= Can I embed testimonials from YouTube, Twitter, or Instagram? =

Yes.

= Can I request a new feature, template function, action hook, or filter? =

I'm all ears!

= Is it true that including a link to my site in my support requests really helps you troubleshoot problems? =

Undeniably, yes.

This [screenshot](http://www.screencast.com/t/TPMRWM0yug) shows where I immediately start looking for clues instead of asking you for more information and potentially waiting hours or days for a response (it happens).

I can determine what theme you're using, what plugins are active, whether you're using any caching/minification/optimization (do you need to clear your cache?), if there are any JavaScript errors in your theme or another plugin (more common than you may think), and somewhat how the testimonial view is configured.

Then, I may attempt to reproduce the problem by creating a test site on my local server and installing your theme and other plugins.
